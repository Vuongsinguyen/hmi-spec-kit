# Dynamic Roles & Permissions

## Model
- Roles and permissions are defined in a config file (e.g., `src/config/roles.json`).
- Each role has a set of permissions (e.g., access/edit/view for subpages and widgets).
- Permissions are checked dynamically in both frontend and backend.

## Rules
- On login, assign user roles dynamically.
- Check permissions before rendering or enabling actions (edit/view/access) for subpages and widgets.
- Restrict API calls and UI elements based on user permissions.
- Permissions can be updated in the config file without code changes.

## Example Permissions
- `subpage:access`, `subpage:edit`, `subpage:view`
- `widget:access`, `widget:edit`, `widget:view`

## Example Usage
```jsx
function canEditSubpage(user) {
   return user.permissions.includes('subpage:edit');
}

function Subpage({ user }) {
   if (!user.permissions.includes('subpage:access')) return <div>No Access</div>;
   return (
      <div>
         {canEditSubpage(user) ? <button>Edit</button> : <span>View Only</span>}
         {/* ...subpage content... */}
      </div>
   );
}
```

# UX/UI Standardization

## General Guidelines
- **Color:** Define primary, secondary, accent, and status colors. Use a consistent palette for all screens and components.
- **Size:** Standardize font sizes, spacing, margins, and paddings for readability and consistency.
- **Icon:** Use a unified icon set for actions, status, and navigation. Document icon usage and meaning.
- **Button:** Specify styles for primary, secondary, disabled, and icon buttons. Include size, color, and interaction states (hover, active, focus).
- **Table:** Standardize table layout, header style, row spacing, sorting/filtering controls, and empty state.
- **Scroll:** Define scroll behavior and appearance for long content, tables, and panels.
- **Header:** Consistent header layout, title placement, and action buttons.
- **Body:** Main content area guidelines, including layout, spacing, and grouping of widgets/components.
- **Footer:** Footer style, placement of status/info, and navigation links.

## Functional Areas
- **Monitoring:** UI standards for real-time data display, status indicators, alarms, and trends.
- **Operation:** Guidelines for control panels, action buttons, feedback, and safety confirmations.
- **Maintenance:** Layout and interaction for diagnostics, logs, and maintenance actions.
- **Settings:** Consistent design for configuration screens, forms, and validation feedback.
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

## UI Structure: Subpage, Widget, Component

# Documentation Standards

## High Level Design (HLD)
- Overview of purpose, responsibilities, and interactions for each Component and Widget.
- Architecture diagram or description.
- Key data flows and integration points.

## Detailed Design (DD)
- Internal logic, state management, and API interactions for each Component and Widget.
- Props, events, lifecycle, error handling.
- Test cases and edge scenarios.

## Common Information & Definitions

- **Component:** Reusable UI building block, encapsulates presentation and local logic.
- **Widget:** Functional unit composed of components, includes backend/API logic, represents a feature (e.g., device control).
- **Subpage:** Container for widgets, represents a logical section or page in the app.
- **CEM (Component Entity Model):** Hierarchical model for machine structure, defines relationships between units, modules, and equipment.
- **CEM Structure:** Organization of CEM entities (units, modules, equipment) and their IO mapping.
- **Unit in CEM:** Fundamental block in CEM, represents a physical or logical part of the machine.
- **Module in CEM:** Group of units, defines a subsystem or functional area.
- **Equipment in CEM:** Top-level entity, represents the whole machine or major assembly.
- **AI/AO/DI/DO:** Analog Input/Output, Digital Input/Output; types of IO devices in automation.
- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment; automated build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- **Integration:** Process of connecting components, widgets, backend, and external systems for seamless operation.

- **Component:** UI building block, reusable, may have local logic/state.
- **Widget:** Composed of components, includes backend/API logic, represents a functional unit (e.g., device control, dashboard card).
- **Subpage:** Container for widgets, represents a page or section in the app.

### Typical Hierarchy
Subpage ‚Üí contains Widgets
Widget ‚Üí built from Components, has its own logic (including backend/API calls)
Component ‚Üí UI building block, may have local logic/state

### Summary
- Component = UI building block
- Widget = UI + backend logic, composed of components
- Subpage = container for widgets

## Architecture Overview
- **Backend:** C++
   - Handles business logic, device communication, and exposes APIs (REST/WebSocket) for frontend.
   - Provides mock data and simulation endpoints when real hardware is unavailable.
- **Frontend:** React + Three.js
   - UI for machine control and monitoring.
   - 3D visualization using Three.js to simulate machine state and actions.

## Simulation & Mocking
- **CEM Structure:**
   - Define Component Entity Model (CEM) for machine: modules, submodules, IO mapping.
- **Mock Data:**
   - **Parameters:** Simulate machine parameters (speed, temperature, etc.).
   - **IO Devices:**
      - DI (Digital Input), DO (Digital Output), AI (Analog Input), AO (Analog Output).
      - Provide mock states and values for each IO type.
- **3D Model:**
   - Use Three.js to visualize machine, animate based on mock data and simulated IO.

## Quality Control
- **Automated Testing:**
   - C++: Unit/integration tests (Google Test, Catch2).
   - React: UI/unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library).
- **Static Analysis:**
   - C++: clang-tidy, cppcheck.
   - React: ESLint, TypeScript.
- **CI/CD:**
   - Integrate automated build, test, and analysis for both backend and frontend.

## Development Notes
- No real machine required for initial development; all device interactions are simulated.
- API endpoints for mock data should be documented for frontend integration.
- 3D model should be modular to reflect CEM structure and IO changes.
